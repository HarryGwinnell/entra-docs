# What is the Sign-in diagnostic in Microsoft Entra ID?

Determining the reason for a failed sign-in can quickly become a challenging task. You need to analyze what happened during the sign-in attempt, and research the available recommendations to resolve the issue. Ideally, you want to resolve the issue without involving others, such as Microsoft support. If you are in a situation like this, you can use the Sign-in diagnostic in Microsoft Entra ID, a tool that helps you investigate sign-ins in Microsoft Entra ID.

This article gives you an overview of what the Sign-in diagnostic is and how you can use it to troubleshoot sign-in related errors.

## Prerequisites

To use the Sign-in diagnostic:

- You must be signed as at least a **Global Reader**.
- Flagged sign-in events can also be reviewed from the Sign-in diagnostic.
  - Flagged sign-in events are captured *after* a user enabled flagging during their sign-in experience.
  - For more information, see [flagged sign-ins](overview-flagged-sign-ins.md).

## How does it work?

In Microsoft Entra ID, sign-in attempts are controlled by:

- **Who** performed a sign-in attempt.
- **How** a sign-in attempt was performed.

For example, you can configure Conditional Access policies that enable administrators to configure all aspects of the tenant when they sign in from the corporate network. But the same user might be blocked when they sign in to the same account from an untrusted network.

Due to the greater flexibility of the system to respond to a sign-in attempt, you might end up in scenarios where you need to troubleshoot sign-ins. The Sign-in diagnostic tool enables diagnosis of sign-in issues by:  

- Analyzing data from sign-in events and flagged sign-ins.  
- Displaying information about what happened.  
- Providing recommendations to resolve problems.  

## How to access the Sign-in diagnostic

1. Select the appropriate fields as necessary. For example:
    - **Service type**: Microsoft Entra Sign-in and multifactor authentication
    - **Problem type**: Multifactor authentication

## How to use the diagnostic results

After the Sign-in diagnostic completes its search, a few things appear on the screen.

The **Authentication summary** lists all of the events that match the details you provided. Select the **View Columns** option in the upper-right corner of the summary to change the columns that appear.

![Screenshot of the Authentication summary.](media/howto-use-sign-in-diagnostics/diagnose-solve-problems-auth-summary.png)

The **Diagnostic results** describe what happened during the sign-in events.
- Scenarios could include MFA requirements from a Conditional Access policy, sign-in events that might need to have a Conditional Access policy applied, or a large number of failed sign-in attempts over the past 48 hours.
- Related content and links to troubleshooting tools might be provided.
- Read through the results to identify any actions that you can take.
- Because it's not always possible to resolve issues without more help, a recommended step might be to open a support ticket.
