# Chat with the Conditional Access optimization agent (preview)

The Conditional Access optimization agent features a conversational interface that enables administrators to interact with the agent using natural language. This chat capability makes it easier to understand suggestions, request more information, and update policy details generated by the agent. With the chat capability you can focus only on the details of the policy suggestion that you need so you can make the right decision.

## What you can do with chat

With the Conditional Access optimization agent chat interface, you can use natural language to get more information on a policy suggestion or have the agent present the suggestions in a different order. 

### Prioritize suggestions

With the chat capability you can ask the agent to help you prioritize the suggestions. The agent compares the potential impact of the policy changes and provides a ranked list of suggestions so you don't have to review the full list and make that decision yourself.

Sample prompts:
- *Which suggestion should I implement first?*
- *Prioritize suggestions*

If you ask the agent to prioritize the list of suggestions then ask it for more details on a specific suggestion, the agent uses the order of the prioritized list.

### Request more detail

Instead of digging through the details of each suggestion, you can ask the agent for more information. After asking the agent to prioritize the full list of suggestions, you can ask it to provide more details on a specific policy suggestion. You can also ask for more details on a policy suggestion by accessing the chat from the policy details.

Sample prompts:
- *Tell me more about the first suggestion.*
- *Explain the suggestion 'Turn on Risky Users policy'.*

If you didn't ask the agent to prioritize the order of the suggestions and you ask for more details on the first suggestion, the agent tells you about the first item in the **Recent suggestions** list.

### Understand agent decisions

In some cases, the agent might identify several policy suggestions that, at first glance, might appear similar to other policies. You can ask the agent to help you understand why one policy was selected for an update when multiple policies could apply. You can ask in the chat why the agent chose a specific policy for update.

Sample prompts:
- *Why was this policy selected for update instead of others?*
- *Explain policy choice.*

### Edit a policy

You can use the chat capability to edit a policy that was referenced in an agent suggestion by changing what users or roles are included or excluded.

Sample prompts:
- *Exclude user1 from this policy.*
- *Add breakglass accounts to this policy.*
- *Include the Helpdesk Administrator role.*

> [!NOTE]
> The Conditional Access optimization agent can identify users and groups that are likely to be emergency ("breakglass") accounts and proactively suggest excluding them from a policy.
>
> At this time, editing included or excluded applications is not supported.
