# Chat with the Conditional Access optimization agent (preview)

The Conditional Access optimization agent features a conversational interface that enables administrators to interact with the Conditional Access optimization agent using natural language.
This chat capability makes it easier to understand recommendations, request more information, and update policy details generated by the agent.
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The chat capability in the Conditional Access Optimization agent is currently in PREVIEW.
> This information relates to a prerelease product that might be substantially modified before release. Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

## Prerequisites

- You must have at least the [Microsoft Entra ID P1](overview.md#license-requirements) license.
- You must have available [security compute units (SCU)](/copilot/security/manage-usage).
- [Global Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#global-administrator), [Security Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-administrator), and [Conditional Access Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator) roles can use the chat capability.

### Limitations

- **Recommendation prioritization context**: If you ask the agent to prioritize recommendations, details are provided using the prioritized order. If you donâ€™t request prioritization, responses appear in the default order shown in the results.
- **Policy editing scope**: Only included and excluded users and roles can be modified using chat. Application assignments and other fields aren't currently supported.
- **Supported scenarios**: Only the scenarios listed in [What you can do with chat](#what-you-can-do-with-chat) are currently available.


## What you can do with chat

With the Conditional Access optimization agent chat interface, you can:
- Prioritize recommendations
    - *Which recommendation should I implement first?*
    - *Prioritize recommendations*
- Request more detail
    - *Tell me more about the first recommendation.*
    - *Explain recommendation 'Turn on Risky Users policy'.*
- Understand why the agent chose a specific policy for update when multiple policies could apply.
    - *Why was this policy selected for update instead of others?*
    - *Explain policy choice.*

    - *Exclude user1 from this policy.*
    - *Add breakglass accounts to this policy.*
    - *Include the Helpdesk Administrator role.*

> [!NOTE]
> The Conditional Access optimization agent can identify users and groups that are likely to be emergency ("breakglass") accounts and proactively suggest excluding them from a policy.
>
> At this time, editing included or excluded applications is not supported.
