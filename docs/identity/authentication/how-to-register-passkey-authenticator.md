# Register passkeys in Authenticator on Android or iOS devices (preview)

This article shows how to register a passkey using Microsoft Authenticator on your iOS or Android device by directly signing into the Authenticator app or by using [Security info](https://aka.ms/mysecurityinfo). For more information on the availability of Microsoft Entra ID passkey (FIDO2) authentication across native apps, web browsers, and operating systems, see [Support for FIDO2 authentication with Microsoft Entra ID](concept-fido2-compatibility.md).

**The *easiest and fastest way* to add a passkey is to add it directly in the Authenticator app.**

Alternatively, you can add a passkey from your mobile device browser, or through cross-device registration using another device, such as a laptop. Your mobile device needs to run iOS version 17, or Android version 14, or later. 

>[!NOTE]
>Support for registering passkeys in Authenticator when attestation is enforced is currently rolling out to iOS Authenticator app users. Support for registering attested passkeys in Authenticator on Android devices is available to all users in the latest version of the app.

### Registration by signing in to Authenticator (iOS) (preview)


You can sign in to Authenticator to create a passkey in the app and get seamless single sign-on (SSO) across Microsoft native apps. **This is the recommended and preferred flow to set up a passkey in Authenticator.** If you're signed in or already have an account in Authenticator, you still need to complete these steps to add a passkey in Authenticator.

1. Download Authenticator from the App Store, open it, and go through the privacy screens.
1. Add your account in Authenticator on your iOS device. Tap **Add account** or the **+** button.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you already have an account in the Authenticator, tap your account in the app, and then tap the settings gear near the upper right of the account details page. Tap **Create a passkey (Preview)**, and skip directly to the sign-in step of the flow.

### Passkey registration from Security info (iOS)

Security info by default will prompt users to sign in to the Authenticator app to register their passkey. 

1. On the same iOS device as the Authenticator or using another device, such as a laptop, open a web browser and sign in with MFA to [Security info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info).

### Alternate registration flow from Security Info (iOS)
If a user is unable to sign in to the Authenticator to register a passkey, you can fall back to triggering registration directly from Security Info. If initiating this flow from a browser on a different device, Bluetooth, an internet connection, and connectivity to these two endpoints must be allowed in your organization to enable cross-device registration and authentication:

- cable.ua5v.com
- cable.auth.com

If your organization restricts Bluetooth usage, you can allow cross-device registration of passkeys by permitting Bluetooth pairing exclusively with passkey-enabled FIDO2 authenticators. For more information about how to configure Bluetooth usage only for passkeys, see [Passkeys in Bluetooth-restricted environments](/windows/security/identity-protection/passkeys/?tabs=windows%2Cintune#passkeys-in-bluetooth-restricted-environments).

1. In Security info, when adding a Passkey in Microsoft Authenticator, tap on **Having trouble**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-register-passwordless-passkey-direct-android/having-trouble-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to register another way if you have trouble.":::

2. Now, tap on **create your passkey a different way**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-register-passwordless-passkey-direct-android/having-trouble.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to register a passkey another way.":::

3. Choose **iPhone or iPad** and go through the rest of the flow to register a passkey on your device.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-register-passwordless-passkey-direct-android/choose-ios-device.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to choose another way on iOS if you have trouble.":::


If a user wants to revert to the original instructions and register a passkey in Microsoft Authenticator through sign in: 

1. In Security Info, when adding a Passkey in Microsoft Authenticator, tap on **Having trouble**.
2. Now, tap on **Create your passkey a different way** by signing into the Authenticator.
3. Go through the rest of the flow to register a passkey on your device. 

## Delete your passkey in Authenticator for iOS

To remove the passkey from Authenticator, tap the account name, tap **Settings**, and then tap **Delete passkey**. 

> [!NOTE]
> In most cases, the passkey is also deleted from [Security info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info). If not, navigate to Security info and click **Delete** to remove it. 

### Troubleshooting

In some cases when you try to register a passkey, it gets stored locally in the Authenticator app but not registered on the authentication server. For example, the passkey provider might not be permitted, or the connection might time out. If you try to register a passkey and see an error that the passkey already exists, [delete the passkey](#delete-your-passkey-in-authenticator-for-ios) that was created locally in Authenticator, and retry registration.
