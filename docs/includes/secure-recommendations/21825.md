When privileged users are allowed to maintain long-lived sign-in sessions without periodic reauthentication, threat actors can gain extended windows of opportunity to exploit compromised credentials or hijack active sessions. Once a privileged account is compromised through techniques like credential theft, phishing, or session fixation, extended session timeouts allow threat actors to maintain persistence within the environment for prolonged periods. With long-lived sessions, threat actors can perform lateral movement across systems, escalate privileges further, and access sensitive resources without triggering additional authentication challenges. The extended session duration also increases the risk window for session hijacking attacks, where threat actors can steal session tokens from memory, network traffic, or browser storage and impersonate the privileged user. Once established within a privileged session, threat actors can perform administrative actions including creating backdoor accounts, modifying security policies, accessing sensitive data, and establishing additional persistence mechanisms. The lack of periodic reauthentication requirements means that even if the original compromise is detected, the threat actor may continue operating undetected using the hijacked privileged session until the session naturally expires or the user manually logs out.
