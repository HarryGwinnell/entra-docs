Global Administrators with persistent access to Azure subscriptions expand the attack surface for threat actors. If a Global Administrator account is compromised, attackers can immediately enumerate resources, modify configurations, assign roles, and exfiltrate sensitive data across all subscriptions. Requiring just-in-time elevation for subscription access introduces detectable signals, slows attacker velocity, and routes high-impact operations through observable control points.

**Remediation action**

- [Remove standing Global Administrator access to Azure subscriptions](/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin) and require explicit elevation
- [Configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Azure resource access](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-configure-role-settings) to enable just-in-time elevation
- [Implement monitoring and alerting for Global Administrator elevation events](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-configure-security-alerts) 
- [Establish approval workflows for high-privilege Azure resource access](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-approval-workflow)
- [Create regular access reviews for Global Administrator assignments](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-create-roles-and-resource-roles-review)
- [Enable Conditional Access policies for privileged role activation](/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-privileged-users-mfa)
