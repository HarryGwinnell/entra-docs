Without configured domain allow/deny lists for external collaboration, organizations lack fundamental domain-level access controls that serve as the first line of defense in the external collaboration security hierarchy. Domain allow/deny lists operate at the tenant level and take precedence over Cross-Tenant Access Policies (XTAP). These policies define scenarios so if a user's domain is on the blocklist, they cannot be invited regardless of cross-tenant access settings. While XTAP provides granular controls for specific known tenants with established trust relationships, domain restrictions are essential for controlling invitations from unknown or unverified domains that have not been explicitly configured in XTAP policies. This configuration gap allows internal users to invite external users from any domain, including potentially compromised or malicious domains that threat actors control, bypassing the more targeted protections that XTAP provides for specific tenant relationships.

When unrestricted domain access is permitted, threat actors can register domains that appear legitimate to conduct social engineering attacks, tricking internal users into extending collaboration invitations to attacker-controlled accounts from domains that fall outside of established XTAP configurations. Once threat actors receive invitations and gain guest access to the tenant, they can perform reconnaissance activities to map internal resources, user relationships, and collaboration patterns within the organization. These externally invited accounts provide threat actors with persistent access that appears legitimate within audit logs and security monitoring systems, enabling them to maintain long-term presence for data collection activities. The external guest accounts can be leveraged to access shared resources, documents, and applications that internal users have configured for external collaboration, potentially leading to data exfiltration through authorized collaboration channels that may not trigger security alerts.
