Organizations without proper activation alerts for highly privileged roles lack visibility into when users access these critical permissions. Threat actors can exploit this monitoring gap to perform privilege escalation by activating highly privileged roles without detection, then establish persistence through admin account creation or security policy modifications. The absence of real-time alerts enables attackers to conduct lateral movement, modify audit configurations, and disable security controls without triggering immediate response procedures.
