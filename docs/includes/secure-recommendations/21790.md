Allowing unrestricted external collaboration with unvetted organizations increases the risk surface area to the tenant because it allows onboarding guest accounts that might not have proper security controls. Threat actors can establish initial access by compromising identities within loosely governed external tenants and leveraging legitimate collaboration pathways to infiltrate resources in your tenant. Once granted guest access, adversaries can attempt to harvest sensitive information, and exploit misconfigured permissions to escalate privileges and try additional attacks. Without vetting the security of organizations you collaborate with, malicious external accounts can persist undetected, exfiltrate confidential data, inject malicious payloads. This unbounded collaboration surface weakens organizational control, enabling cross-tenant attacks that bypass traditional perimeter defenses and undermine both data integrity and operational resilience. 

Cross-tenant access settings for outbound access in Entra  provides a mechanism to block collaboration by default with unknown organizations, reducing the attack surface created. 

**Remediation action**

- [Disable inactive privileged service principals](/graph/api/serviceprincipal-update)
- Investigate if the application has legitimate use cases. If so, [analyze if a OAuth2 permission is a better fit](/entra/identity-platform/v2-app-types)
- [If service principal doesn't have legitimate use cases, delete it](/graph/api/serviceprincipal-delete)
