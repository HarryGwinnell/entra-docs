Assigning privileged roles to workload identities, such as service principals or managed identities, exposes the tenant to significant risk if those identities are compromised. Threat actors who gain access to a privileged workload identity can perform reconnaissance to enumerate resources, escalate privileges, and manipulate or exfiltrate sensitive data. The attack chain typically can begin with credential theft or abuse of a vulnerable application, followed by privilege escalation through the assigned role, lateral movement across cloud resources, and persistence via additional role assignments or credential updates. Because workload identities are often used in automation and may not be monitored as closely as user accounts, their compromise can go undetected, allowing threat actors to maintain access and control over critical resources. This risk is amplified by the fact that workload identities are not subject to user-centric protections like MFA, making least-privilege assignment and regular review essential. 

**Remediation action**
- [Review and remove privileged roles assignments](../../id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles.md#update-or-remove-an-existing-role-assignment).
- [Follow the best practices for workload identities](../../workload-id/workload-identities-overview.md#key-scenarios).
- [Learn about privileged roles and permissions in Microsoft Entra ID](../../identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions.md)
