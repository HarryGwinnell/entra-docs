When Microsoft services applications (service principals with the owner organization ID "f8cdef31-a31e-4b4a-93e4-5f571e91255a") have credentials configured in your tenant, it might create potential attack vectors that threat actors can exploit. If credentials were added by administrator and no longer needed, they can become a target of attackers; although less likely when proper preventive and detective controls are in place on privileged activities, credentials can also be added maliciously by threat actors. In either case, threat actors can use these credentials to authenticate as the service principal, gaining the same permissions and access rights as the Microsoft service application. This initial access can lead to privilege escalation if the application has high-level permissions, allowing lateral movement across the tenant. Attackers can then proceed to data exfiltration or persistence establishment through creating additional backdoor credentials.  

 

Risk Level: High – Wide spread impact if credentials are misused 

User Impact: Low - Users should not be affected on their daily usage of Microsoft Services 

Implementation  Cost: Low –  Effort is targeted and remediated 

**Remediation action**

- [Disable inactive privileged service principals](/graph/api/serviceprincipal-update)
- Investigate if the application has legitimate use cases. If so, [analyze if a OAuth2 permission is a better fit](/entra/identity-platform/v2-app-types)
- [If service principal doesn't have legitimate use cases, delete it](/graph/api/serviceprincipal-delete)
