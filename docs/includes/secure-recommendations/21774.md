Microsoft services applications that operate in your tenant are identified as service principals with the owner organization ID "f8cdef31-a31e-4b4a-93e4-5f571e91255a". When these service principals have credentials configured in your tenant, they might create potential attack vectors that threat actors can exploit. If the credentials were added by an administrator and are no longer needed, they can become a target for attackers. Although less likely when proper preventive and detective controls are in place on privileged activities, credentials can also be added maliciously by threat actors. In either case, threat actors can use these credentials to authenticate as the service principal, gaining the same permissions and access rights as the Microsoft service application. This initial access can lead to privilege escalation if the application has high-level permissions, allowing lateral movement across the tenant. Attackers can then proceed to data exfiltration or persistence establishment through creating additional backdoor credentials.

When credentials (like client secrets or certificates) are configured for these service principals in your tenant, it means someone - either an administrator or a malicious actor - has enabled them to authenticate independently within your environment. These credentials should be investigated to determine their legitimacy and necessity. If they are no longer needed, they should be removed to reduce the risk. If they are still required, consider using OAuth2 permissions instead of credentials for better security practices.

**Remediation action**

- [Disable inactive privileged service principals](/graph/api/serviceprincipal-update)
- Investigate if the application has legitimate use cases. If so, [analyze if a OAuth2 permission is a better fit](/entra/identity-platform/v2-app-types)
- [If service principal doesn't have legitimate use cases, delete it](/graph/api/serviceprincipal-delete)
