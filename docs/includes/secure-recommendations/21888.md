Unmaintained or orphaned redirect URIs in app registrations create significant security vulnerabilities when they reference domains that no longer point to active resources. Threat actors can exploit these "dangling" DNS entries by provisioning resources at abandoned domains, effectively taking control of redirect endpoints. This enables attackers to intercept authentication tokens and credentials during OAuth 2.0 flows, leading to unauthorized access, session hijacking, and potential broader organizational compromise.

**Remediation action**

- [Regularly audit and review redirect URIs in app registrations](/entra/identity-platform/reply-url) to identify obsolete or unmaintained entries
- [Remove unused or orphaned redirect URIs](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app#add-a-redirect-uri) from application configurations
- [Implement monitoring for domain ownership](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain) of all redirect URI domains
- [Establish domain validation processes](/entra/identity-platform/reply-url#restrictions-on-wildcards-and-localhost) to ensure active control of redirect endpoints
- [Configure application management policies](/graph/api/resources/applicationauthenticationmethodpolicy) to enforce redirect URI validation requirements
- [Create regular security reviews](/entra/identity/governance/access-reviews-overview) of application redirect URI configurations
