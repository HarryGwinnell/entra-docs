Azure Logic Apps integrated with Microsoft Entra Identity Governance create a significant attack surface when access controls are inadequate. Threat actors can exploit misaligned permissions between Logic Apps management roles and Entra directory roles to gain initial access through compromised accounts with excessive Azure RBAC permissions. Once accessed, threat actors can modify workflow logic to insert malicious automation into provisioning processes, then use managed identities and existing connections for lateral movement across connected systems.

**Remediation action**

- [Implement least privilege access for Logic Apps used in identity governance workflows](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app#access-and-security-policies)
- [Configure managed identity authentication for Logic Apps to reduce credential exposure](/azure/logic-apps/create-managed-service-identity)
- [Establish proper Azure RBAC role assignments aligned with Microsoft Entra directory roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/best-practices)
- [Enable diagnostic logging and monitoring for Logic Apps used in identity governance](/azure/logic-apps/monitor-logic-apps)
- [Implement Conditional Access policies for service principals used by Logic Apps](/entra/identity/conditional-access/workload-identity)
- [Review and audit Logic Apps connections and permissions regularly](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app#secure-parameters-and-inputs-within-a-workflow)
