There are different roles, permissions, and license requirements to view health monitoring signals and configure and receive alerts. Apart from Microsoft Entra admin roles, Microsoft Graph permissions are required to access health monitoring signals and alerts via the Microsoft Graph APIs. We recommend using a role with least privilege access to align with the [Zero Trust guidance](/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview).

- A tenant with a [Microsoft Entra P1 or P2 license](~/fundamentals/get-started-premium.md) is required to **view** the Microsoft Entra health scenario monitoring signals.
- A tenant with both a [Microsoft Entra P1 or P2 license](~/fundamentals/get-started-premium.md) *and* at least 100 monthly active users is required to **view alerts** and **receive alert notifications**.
