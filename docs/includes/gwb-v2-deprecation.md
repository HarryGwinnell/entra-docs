>[!IMPORTANT]
>The public preview of Group Writeback v2 in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync is deprecated and no longer supported.
> 
>We have a similar functionality in Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync called Group Provision to Active Directory that you can use instead of Group Writeback v2 for provisioning cloud security groups to Active Directory.
> 
>Customers who use this preview feature in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync should switch their configuration from Microsoft Entra Connect Sync to Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync. We highly recommend you move your sync client to Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync. You can evaluate whether you are eligible to move to Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync by using the user synchronization wizard
> 
>If you cannot use Microsoft Cloud Sync (as per sync wizard recommendation), You can also run Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync side by side and move only cloud security group provisioning to Active Directory onto Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync.
> 
>For customers who provision Microsoft 365 groups to Active Directory, you can keep using Group Writeback v1 for this capability.
