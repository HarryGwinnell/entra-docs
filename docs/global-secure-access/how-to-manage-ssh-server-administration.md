# Management for SSH-based server administration

Secure Shell (SSH) is widely recognized across the IT industry as a critical service for system administrators. It provides a secure and encrypted method to access and manage remote systems over unsecured networks.
IT administrators rely on SSH to perform essential tasks securely, including the configuration, deployment, and maintenance of servers and applications in an organizationâ€™s infrastructure.
 
In this guide and [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6gTjAK-Y0Y), you learn how to configure and establish an SSH connection using Microsoft Entra Private Access to enhance security in your remote access workflows.

You can [learn more about Private Access](concept-private-access.md).

## Establish SSH connections with Private Access

Microsoft Entra Private Access enhances the security and efficiency of SSH management traffic by providing a secure, identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution by allowing IT administrators to establish SSH connections to remote servers securely.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you meet the following prerequisites.

* **Licensing** - Learn about licensing for [Microsoft Global Secure Access](overview-what-is-global-secure-access.md)
  * Learn more about [Microsoft Entra plans and pricing](https://aka.ms/azureadlicense)
  * See, [Global Secure Access client for Windows](how-to-install-windows-client.md)
* **A remote server with SSH** enabled
* **Microsoft Global Secure Access private connector** with network connectivity to the resource
  * Learn how to [configure connectors](how-to-configure-connectors.md)
* **A device with the Global Secure Access client**
* **Private Access profile** enabled
  * See [Global Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md)
* **[Global Secure Access Administrator role](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference)** for admins
  * Learn about [built-in roles](reference-role-based-permissions.md)

## Configure Private Access

Use the following instructions to create the application.

1. Browse to **Global Secure Access**.
2. Select **Applications**, then select **Enterprise application**.
3. Select **New application**. 
4. Type a name.
5. The **Create application segment** panel appears.
6. (Optional) Add application segments.
7. Select a **Destination type**. 
8. Add needed IPs or subnets. 
9. For **Port**, select **22**. 
10. For **Protocol**, select **TCP**. 
11. (Optional) Add application segments. 
12. Select **Save**.

Assign users and groups to the application.

1. Browse to **Global Secure Access**.
2. Select **Applications**, then select **Enterprise application**.
3. Locate the application you created.
4. Select **Users and groups**.
5. Add users and groups that require access.

Create [Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](../identity/conditional-access/overview.md) policy for the application and configure policies for app access at the application level. You can create and apply policy in two places: 

1. Browse to **Global Secure Access**.
2. Select **Applications**, then select **Enterprise application**.
3. Select an application.
4. Select **Conditional Access**.
5. Select **New policy**.
6. Go to Protection.
7. Select **Conditional Access**, then select **Policies**.
8. In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/), create and apply policy in two places.
9. Select **+ Create new policy**.

For more information, see [Apply Conditional Access policies to Private Access apps](how-to-target-resource-private-access-apps.md). 

## Global Secure Access client review and testing

In this section, find links to guidance to install and configure the Microsoft Global Secure Access [client](concept-clients.md) on user devices.  

To install on operating systems, see [Windows](how-to-install-windows-client.md) and [macOS](how-to-install-macos-client.md).  

### Configuration checklist

Use the following checklist to help confirm configuration.

* Ensure the server is running and accessible by the SSH port.
* Confirm the correct host firewall configuration.
  * Find guidance in [OpenSSH Server configuration for Windows](/windows-server/administration/OpenSSH/openssh-server-configuration).
* Go to the Windows taskbar. Right-click the **Global Secure Access** client.
  * Select **Advanced Diagnostics** > **Forwarding profile** > **Private Access**.
  * Validate the application appears in the access profile.
* Access the SSH services from the client device.  

## Connection failure

If the connection fails, use the following checklist.

* Verify the server IP address and port number. 
* Confirm the SSH port is allowed from a Private Connector server. 
* Isolate firewall rules that might block SSH traffic. 
* Validate the Global Secure Access client captures traffic. 
* Verify users are assigned to the application.
