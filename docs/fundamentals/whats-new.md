## October 2024

### Public Preview - Passkey authentication in brokered Microsoft apps on Android

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

Microsoft Entra ID users can now use a passkey to sign into Microsoft apps on Android devices where an authentication broker like Microsoft Authenticator, or Microsoft Intune Company Portal, is installed. For more information, see: [Support for FIDO2 authentication with Microsoft Entra ID](../identity/authentication/concept-fido2-compatibility.md).

---

### Public Preview Refresh - Passkeys in Microsoft Authenticator

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

Public preview of passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator will now support additional features. Admins can now require attestation during registration of a passkey, and Android native apps now supports signing in with passkeys in the Authenticator. Additionally, users are now prompted to sign in to the Authenticator app to register a passkey when initiating the flow from MySignIns. The Authenticator app passkey registration wizard walks the user through meeting all the prerequisites within the context of the app before attempting registration. Download the latest version of the Authenticator app and give us feedback as you pilot these changes in your organization. For more information, see: [Enable passkeys in Microsoft Authenticator (preview)](../identity/authentication/how-to-enable-authenticator-passkey.md).

---

### Public Preview - Authentication methods migration wizard

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** MFA    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

The authentication methods migration guide (preview) in the Microsoft Entra admin center lets you automatically migrate method management from the [legacy MFA and SSPR policies](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage.md#legacy-mfa-and-sspr-policies) to the [converged authentication methods policy](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage.md). In 2023, it was announced that the ability to manage authentication methods in the legacy MFA and SSPR policies would be retired in September 2025. Until now, organizations had to manually migrate methods themselves by leveraging [the migration toggle](../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-methods-manage.md#start-the-migration) in the converged policy. Now, you can migrate in just a few selections by using the migration guide. The guide evaluates what your organization currently has enabled in both legacy policies, and generates a recommended converged policy configuration for you to review and edit as needed. From there, simply confirm the configuration and we set it up for you and mark your migration as complete. For more information, see: [How to migrate MFA and SSPR policy settings to the Authentication methods policy for Microsoft Entra ID](../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-methods-manage.md).

## September 2024

### Public preview - New Conditional Access Template Requiring Device Compliance 

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Conditional Access    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

A new Conditional Access template requiring device compliance is now available in Public Preview. This template restricts access to company resources exclusively to devices enrolled in mobile device management (MDM) and compliant with company policy. Requiring device compliance improves data security, reducing risk of data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access. This is a recommended best practice for users and devices targeted by compliance policy through MDM. For more information, see: [Common policy: Create a Conditional Access policy requiring device compliance.](../identity/conditional-access/policy-all-users-device-compliance.md)

### Public preview - Tenant admin can fail certificate based auth when the end user certificate issuer isn't configured with a certificate revocation list

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

With Certificate based authentication, a CA can be uploaded without a CRL endpoint, and certificate-based authentication won't fail if an issuing CA doesn't have a CRL specified.

To strengthen security and avoid misconfigurations, an Authentication Policy Administrator can require CBA authentication to fail if no CRL is configured for a CA that issues an end user certificate. For more information, see: [Understanding CRL validation (Preview)](../identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive.md#understanding-crl-validation-preview).

---

### General Availability: Microsoft Authenticator on Android is FIPS 140 compliant for Microsoft Entra authentication

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

Beginning with version 6.2408.5807, Microsoft Authenticator for Android is compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 140-3) for all Microsoft Entra authentications, including phishing-resistant device-bound passkeys, push multifactor authentication (MFA), passwordless phone sign-in (PSI), and time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP). No changes in configuration are required in Microsoft Authenticator or Microsoft Entra ID Admin Portal to enable this capability. Microsoft Authenticator on iOS is already FIPS 140 compliant, as announced last year. For more information, see: [Authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID - Microsoft Authenticator app](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app.md).

---

### General Availability - Microsoft Entra External ID extension for Visual Studio Code

**Type:** Changed feature    
**Service category:** B2C - Consumer Identity Management    
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C    

[Microsoft Entra External ID Extension for VS Code](https://aka.ms/ciamvscode/newsletter/marketplace) provides a streamlined, guided experience to help you kickstart identity integration for customer-facing apps. With this extension, you can create external tenants, set up a customized and branded sign-in experience for external users, and quickly bootstrap your projects with preconfigured External ID samplesâ€”all within Visual Studio Code. Additionally, you can view and manage your external tenants, applications, user flows, and branding settings directly within the extension.

For more information, see: [Quickstart: Get started with the Microsoft Entra External ID extension for Visual Studio Code](../external-id/customers/visual-studio-code-extension.md).

### Public Preview - Custom Claims API for Claims Configuration of Enterprise Apps

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps    
**Product capability:** SSO    

Custom Claims API allows admins to manage and update additional claims for their Enterprise Applications seamlessly through MS Graph. The Custom Claims API offers a simplified and user friendly API experience for claims management for our customers. With the introduction of Custom Claims API, we achieved UX and API interoperability. Admins can now use Microsoft Entra admin center and MS Graph API interchangeably to manage claims configurations for their Enterprise Applications. It facilitates admins to execute their automations using the API while allowing the flexibility to update claims on the Microsoft Entra admin center as required on the same policy object. For more information, see: [Customize claims using Microsoft Graph Custom Claims Policy (preview)](../identity-platform/claims-customization-custom-claims-policy.md).

---

### General Availability - Cross-tenant manager synchronization

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Provisioning    
**Product capability:** Identity Governance    

Support for synchronizing the manager attribute using cross-tenant synchronization is now generally available. For more information, see: [Attributes](../identity/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-overview.md#attributes).

---

### Public Preview - Request on behalf of

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Entitlement Management    
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management    

Entitlement Management enables admins to create access packages to manage their organizationâ€™s resources. Admins can either directly assign users to an access package, or configure an access package policy that allows users and group members to request access. This option to create self-service processes is useful, especially as organizations scale and hire more employees. However, new employees joining an organization might not always know what they need access to, or how they can request access. In this case, a new employee would likely rely on their manager to guide them through the access request process.

Instead of having new employees navigate the request process, managers can request access packages for their employees, making onboarding faster and more seamless. To enable this functionality for managers, admins can select an option when setting up an access package policy that allows managers to request access on their employees' behalf.

Expanding self-service request flows to allow requests on behalf of employees ensures that users have timely access to necessary resources, and increases productivity. For more information, see: [Request access package on-behalf-of other users (Preview)](../id-governance/entitlement-management-request-behalf.md).

## August 2024

### Change announcement - Upcoming MFA Enforcement on Microsoft Entra admin center

**Type:** Plan for change     
**Service category:** MFA   
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

As part of our commitment to providing our customers with the highest level of security, we previously [announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/update-on-mfa-requirements-for-azure-sign-in/ba-p/4177584) that Microsoft requires multifactor authentication (MFA) for users signing into Azure.

We'd like to share an update that the scope of MFA enforcement includes [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) in addition to the Azure portal and Intune admin center. This change is rolled out in phases, allowing organizations time to plan their implementation:

**Phase 1**: Beginning in the second half of the calendar year 2024, MFA is required to sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center, Azure portal, and Intune admin center. This enforcement is gradually rolled out to all tenants worldwide. This phase didn't affect other Azure clients such as the Azure Command Line Interface, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.

**Phase 2**: Beginning in early 2025, gradual enforcement of MFA at sign-in for the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools commences.

Microsoft sends a 60-day advance notice to all Microsoft Entra Global Administrators by email, and through Azure Service Health Notifications, to notify them of the start date of enforcement and required actions. Extra notifications are sent through the Azure portal, Microsoft Entra admin center, and the Microsoft 365 message center.

We understand that some customers might need extra time to prepare for this MFA requirement. Therefore, Microsoft allows extended time for customers with complex environments or technical barriers. The notification from us also includes details about how customers can postpone specific changes. These changes include the start date of enforcement for their tenants, the duration of the postponement, and a link to apply changes. Visit [here](../identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication.md) to learn more.

### General Availability - restricted permissions on Directory Synchronization Accounts (DSA) role in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync

**Type:** Changed feature     
**Service category:** Provisioning   
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connects    

As part of ongoing security hardening, Microsoft removes unused permissions from the privileged *Directory Synchronization Accounts* role. This role is exclusively used by Microsoft Entra Connect Sync, and Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync, to synchronize Active Directory objects with Microsoft Entra ID. There's no action required by customers to benefit from this hardening, and the revised role permissions are documented here: [Directory Synchronization Accounts](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#directory-synchronization-accounts).

---

### Plan for change - My Security-Info Add sign-in method picker UX update

**Type:** Plan for change     
**Service category:** MFA   
**Product capability:** End User Experiences    

Starting Mid-October 2024, the *Add sign-in* method dialog on the My Security-Info page will be updated with a modern look and feel. With this change, new descriptors will be added under each method which provides detail to users on how the sign-in method is used (ex. *Microsoft Authenticator â€“ Approve sign-in requests* or *use one-time codes*).  

Early next year the *Add sign-in* method, dialog will be enhanced to show an initially recommended sign-in method instead of initially showing the full list of sign-in methods available to register. The recommended sign-in method will default to the strongest method available to the user based on the organizationâ€™s authentication method policy. Users can select *Show more options* and choose from all available sign-in methods allowed by their policy.

This change will occur automatically, so admins take no action.

---

### Public Preview - Provisioning UX Updates

**Type:** Plan for change    
**Service category:** Provisioning    
**Product capability:** Outbound to SaaS Applications    

We'll start releasing user experience updates for application provisioning, HR provisioning, and cross-tenant synchronization next month.
