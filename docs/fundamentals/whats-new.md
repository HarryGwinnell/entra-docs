## August 2024

### Change announcement - Upcoming MFA Enforcement on Microsoft Entra admin center

**Type:** Plan for change     
**Service category:** MFA   
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

As part of our commitment to providing our customers with the highest level of security, we previously [announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/update-on-mfa-requirements-for-azure-sign-in/ba-p/4177584) that Microsoft will require multifactor authentication (MFA) for users signing into Azure.

We'd like to share an update that the scope of MFA enforcement includes [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) in addition to the Azure portal and Intune admin center. This change will be rolled out in phases, allowing organizations time to plan their implementation:

**Phase 1**: Starting in the second half of the calendar year 2024, MFA will be required to sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center, Azure portal, and Intune admin center. This enforcement will gradually roll out to all tenants worldwide. This phase won't impact other Azure clients such as the Azure Command Line Interface, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.

**Phase 2**: Beginning in early 2025, gradual enforcement of MFA at sign-in for the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools will commence.

Microsoft will send a 60-day advance notice to all Entra Global Administrators by email, and through Azure Service Health Notifications, to notify them of the start date of enforcement and required actions. Additional notifications will be sent through the Azure portal, Microsoft Entra admin center, and the Microsoft 365 message center.

We understand that some customers might need additional time to prepare for this MFA requirement. Therefore, Microsoft will allow extended time for customers with complex environments or technical barriers. The notification from us will also include details about how customers can postpone the start date of enforcement for their tenants, the duration of the postponement, and a link to apply. Visit [here](../identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication.md) to learn more.

### Plan for change - My Security-Info Add sign-in method picker UX update

**Type:** Plan for change     
**Service category:** MFA   
**Product capability:** End User Experiences    

Starting late August 2024, the "*add sign-in method*" dialog on the My Security-Info page will be updated with improved sign-in method descriptions, and a modern look and feel. With this change when users select "*add sign-in method*", they'll initially be recommended to register the strongest method available to them which is allowed by organizational authentication method policy. Users have the ability to select "*show more options*", and choose from all available sign-in methods allowed by their policy.

### Decommissioning of Group Writeback V2 (Public Preview) in Entra Connect Sync

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Provisioning                     
**Product capability:**  Microsoft Entra Connect Sync             

The public preview of Group Writeback V2 (GWB) in Entra Connect Sync will no longer be available after June 30, 2024. After this date, Connect Sync will no longer support provisioning cloud security groups to Active Directory.

Another similar functionality is offered in Entra Cloud Sync, called “*Group Provision to AD*”, that maybe used instead of GWB V2 for provisioning cloud security groups to AD. Enhanced functionality in Cloud Sync, along with other new features, are being developed.

Customers who use this preview feature in Connect Sync should [switch their configuration from Connect Sync to Cloud Sync](../identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/migrate-group-writeback.md).
